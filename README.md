## Writings:

* How do people convey emotions through sound and music?
  * We have to distinguish between the emotions that music convey and the emotions that music evoke (i.e, what emotion is the music itself and how we perceive it). "Induced emotion (also known as felt emotion) is the emotion experienced by the listener whereas the perceived emotion (also known as expressed emotion) is the emotion recognized in the music" [3].

* How do people understand others' emotions in sound and music?

* Why do people's emotions in sound and music matter?
  * Reasons:
    * To better classify music into group given the context (e.g: coffee shop, gymnastic, etc.)
    * Evoking emotional response itself
    * Neural research in the relationship between emotion and music [4].

* What can people do if they understand the emotions in sound and music?
