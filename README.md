* There two type of emotion conveyed by music: induced emotion and perceived emotion. Induced emotion is the emotion felt by human when they listen to a particular piece of music, while perceived emotion is theo type of emotion that are described and conveyed by the the actual piece of music.

* Emotional Representation [9]:
  * Russell's circumplex model (Arousal-Valence emotional map) [6-8]: the emotion of the music is described by a graph with two dimensions, the valence axis (x-axis) represents the emotional positivity (the higher valence the more positive emotion), and the arousal axis (y-axis) represents the emotional intensity (the higher arousal the more energy in the piece of music)
  * Classification

* How do people convey emotions through sound and music?
  * We have to distinguish between the emotions that music convey and the emotions that music evoke (i.e, what emotion is the music itself and how we perceive it). "Induced emotion (also known as felt emotion) is the emotion experienced by the listener whereas the perceived emotion (also known as expressed emotion) is the emotion recognized in the music" [3].
